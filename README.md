# Thermodynamic-Analysis-of-Oxygen
As part of a Course Project under Prof. Abhijit Chatterjee at the Chemical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay, I developed a MATLAB-based numerical solver to accurately compute the thermodynamic properties of oxygen using the Peng-Robinson equation of state. The model included phase equilibrium analysis and precise property estimations. I implemented phase equilibrium calculations, such as vapor pressure determination and fugacity analysis, to enhance the accuracy of thermodynamic predictions. Additionally, I applied polynomial curve fitting to vapor-liquid coexistence data, improving the precision of Clapeyron equation-based enthalpy and entropy computations. To further strengthen the analysis, I visualized thermodynamic property variations through detailed plots of enthalpy, entropy, and phase transitions across different temperatures, providing a comprehensive understanding of oxygen's phase behavior.
